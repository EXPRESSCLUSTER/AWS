# EC2 Image Builder
An [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/faqs/) gives the following description of EC2 Image Builder: it \"simplifies the creation, maintenance, validation, sharing, and deployment of Linux or Windows images for use with Amazon EC2 and on-premises.\"    

New images can be created and deployed manually or on a set schedule. These images can automatically include the latest OS updates, a number of preset components specified by AWS, or your own components to install and configure custom software. YAML configuration files can be used with PowerShell scripts to install and configure ExpressCluster X on Windows images. These files can be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and utilized during the image build process.
